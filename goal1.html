      			<h3>What's the Goal here?</h3>
      			<p>To end poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030.</p>
      			<h3>Why?</h3>
      			<p>
      				In 2015, more than 700 million people, or 10 per cent of the world population, lived in extreme poverty, struggling to fulfil the most basic needs like health, education, and access to water and sanitation, to name a few. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is reversing the trend of poverty reduction with tens of millions of people in risk of being pushed back into extreme poverty - people living on less than $1.90/day - causing the first increase in global poverty in more than 20 years.
      			</p>
      			<p>Even before COVID-19, baseline projections suggested that 6 per cent of the global population would still be living in extreme poverty in 2030, missing the target of ending poverty.</p>
      			<p>
      				Having a job also doesnot guarantee a decentliving. In fact, 7.1 per cent of employed workers and their families worldwide lived in extreme poverty in 2019, a positive decline compared to 2010, but the number is expected to rise in light of the long-term consequences of the pandemic.
      			</p>
      		</div>
      		<div class="column box2">
      			<h3>Why is there so much poverty in the world?</h3>
      			<p>
      				Poverty has many dimensions, but its causes include unemployment, social exclusion, and high vulnerability of certain populations to disasters, diseases and other phenomena which prevent them from being productive.
      			</p>
      			<h3>Why should I care about other people’s economic situation?</h3>
      			<p>
      				There are many reasons, but in short, because as human beings, our wellbeing is linked to each other. Growing inequality is detrimental to economic growth and undermines social cohesion, increasing political and social tensions and, in some circumstances, driving instability and conflicts.
      			</p>
      			<h3>
      				Why is social protectionso important?
      			</h3>
      			<p>
      				The COVID-19 pandemic will have both immediate and long-term economic consequences for people across the globe. Strong social protection systems are essential for mitigating the effects and preventing many people from falling into poverty. Nevertheless, 55 per cent of the world’s population – about 4 billion people – did not benefit from any form of social protection in 2016. Only 22 per cent of unemployed workers were covered by unemployment benefits.

      	<h2>Facts And Figures</h2>
      	<ol>
      		<li>
      			According to the most recent estimates, in 2015, 10 percent of the world’s population or 734 million people lived on less than $1.90 a day.
      		</li>
      		<li>
      			Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are expected to see the largest increases in extreme poverty, with an additional 32 million and 26 million people, respectively, living below the international poverty line as a result of the pandemic.
      		</li>
      		<li>
      			The share of the world’s workers living in extreme poverty fell by half over the last decade: from 14.3 per cent in 2010 to 7.1 per cent in 2019.
      		</li>
      		<li>
      			Even before COVID-19, baseline projections suggested that 6 per cent of the global population would still be living in extreme poverty in 2030, missing the target of ending poverty. The fallout from the pandemic threatens to push over 70 million people into extreme poverty.
      		</li>
      		<li>
      			One out of five children live in extreme poverty, and the negative effects of poverty and deprivation in the early years have ramifications that can last a lifetime. 
      		</li>

				In 2016, 55 per cent of the world’s population – about 4 billion people – did not benefit from any form of social protection
